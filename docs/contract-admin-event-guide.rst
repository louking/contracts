   :caption: Contents:

The system is used to manage bookings and contracts for the Steeplechasers race services 
business. The primary functions provided by the system include:

* online availability calendar
* race database, providing online schedule and details of races and clients
* electronic contract generation, signing and archival capabilities
* Email system designed to automate the communication with race directors, race 
  services administrators and race services leads
* Automated initialization of the preliminary schedule for the current year from the 
  previous year's bookings

This system is designed to significantly reduce the administrative workload
required to manage the club's race services business.

.. _event-email-conventions:

Email Conventions
======================

All emails generated by the system use raceservices@steeplechasers.org as the
from address. Emails that are generated at a race director’s direction from the
FSRC website are addressed TO raceservices@steeplechasers.org. This email
address is associated with one or more individuals in the steeplechasers.org
organization, and those individuals will receive the email. When responding to
this email, individuals should ALWAYS respond from their steeplechasers.org
email address and copy raceservices@steeplechasers.org to ensure that all
communication is shared with the race services team.


.. _event-life-cycle:

Event Life Cycle
======================

Summary:

#. Race Director contacts FSRC to request race services, either through direct 
   email or a form on the FSRC website
#. Race services admin corresponds with race director, obtaining required 
   details of client, race, and requested services.
#. Race services admin enters data into contractility system and uses system 
   to generate and send contract
#. Race Director agrees to contract electronically
#. FSRC Treasurer generates invoice
#. Race Director and FSRC Race Lead receive automated emails 5 days before 
   event with logistical information
#. Race Director receives email after event with link to survey
#. Race is automatically renewed for following year and placed in tentative 
   state until FSRC and race director resume correspondence

Detail:

This describes the life cycle for event management.

   * New Race: Race director sends Race Services Request email
     
     * see :ref:`contact-new-race`
   
   * Renewed Event: Race director responds to the :ref:`post-event-email` or :ref:`post-event-email-reminder` 

     * if the race director says that the race will not be held

       * from :ref:`admin-calendar-view` click on the :term:`event` or from :ref:`event-overview-view`, 
         select the :term:`event`, click **Edit**, then click **Delete**

     * if the race director says they're not sure, or they don't have all the required information yet

       * from :ref:`admin-calendar-view` click on the :term:`event` or from :ref:`event-overview-view`, 
         select the :term:`event`, click **Edit**, change **State** to *tentative*, 
         then click **Update**

   * Details are learned from the race director about an :term:`event` that is
     in the system but not yet committed

     * see :ref:`race-details-confirmed`
     * from :ref:`admin-calendar-view` click on the :term:`event` or from :ref:`event-overview-view`, 
       select the :term:`event`, click **Edit**
     * make sure **State** is set to *tentative*
     * update the details which are known, then click **Update**

   * All details are known for the :term:`event`, and the race director is ready to move forward 

     * see :ref:`race-details-confirmed`
     * click **Update and Send Contract** to generate a contract
     * :ref:`contract-email` is automatically generated to the race director 

   * About 5 days before the :term:`event`

     * :ref:`pre-event-coordination-email` is automatically generated, to the race director and event :term:`lead`

   * About 2 days before the :term:`event`
     
     * a reminder email automatically generated, just to the :term:`event` :term:`lead`

   * About 5 days after the :term:`event`

     * for :term:`events <event>` which have *finishline* or *coursemarking* :term:`services <service>`, 
       :ref:`post-event-email` is automatically generated
     * regardless of service, the :term:`event` is :term:`renewed <renew>`
     * see :ref:`post-event-processing` for additional details

   * If the :term:`event` is still in *renewed-pending* state 120 days before the expected date of the race

     * :ref:`post-event-email-reminder` is automatically generated to the race director 
       [pending implementation of https://github.com/louking/contracts/issues/155]

   * If the :term:`event` is still in *renewed-pending* state 30 days before the expected date of the race

     * an email is automatically generated to raceservices@steeplechasers.org to indicate event
       is still outstanding [pending implementation of https://github.com/louking/contracts/issues/165]
     * admin should delete the event manually
     * from :ref:`admin-calendar-view` click on the :term:`event` or from 
       :ref:`event-overview-view`, select the :term:`event`, click **Edit** to get to the :ref:`edit-event-view`, 
       then click **Delete**

.. _use-cases:

Use Cases (What To Do...)
=========================


.. _log-in:

When You Want to Log In
-------------------------
From the contractility home page, click on `log in` in the upper right corner. You will be shown a google sign in 
challenge similar to below. Sign in with your steeplechasers.org account.

.. image:: images/choose-account.*
   :align: center

If this is your first time using the application, you be shown the following, which will give the application permission to create files in G Suite on your behalf. Click Allow

.. image:: images/sign-in-challenge.*
   :align: center


.. _contact-new-race:

When We Learn About a New Race
------------------------------

We learn about a completely new :term:`race` that we have never provided
services for. The inquiry could arrive either through email generated by the
:ref:`race-services-request-view`,  a direct email, etc. Often there is
incomplete information. Regardless, you should create the :term:`event` with
whatever information you have.

You can create an :term:`event` in one of two ways.

1. From :ref:`admin-calendar-view` click on the :term:`event` date
2. From :ref:`event-overview-view` click **New**

Once the form is displayed

   * fill in as much information as you have available to you
   * click **Create**

**If the Race has Finish Line Services** - Race directors may be contacting you with incomplete
information, and if so you will have to chase them down  to find all the relevant bits. This may
have to be done over time as often when they first contact us they may not have  all of the
information themselves.

**If the Race has Only Premium Promotion** - Premium promotion is executed through the
communications group rather than race services. We'll still be using  this tool to track that. It is
expected that the communication group will look at the **contractility** data periodically to
determine what races are to be promoted. See :ref:`contract-for-premium-promotion` for more details.


.. _contact-legacy-race:

When We're Contacted for a Race We've Done Before
------------------------------------------------------

If we've done a :term:`race` before, there will already be a database entry for
the :term:`race`, and likely the :term:`event` was :term:`renewed <renew>` after
the previous year's race. 

You need to verify the current details with the race director and update the
:term:`event` which was created as a result of the automatic renewal process.

You can find the event to edit in one of two ways.

   1. from :ref:`event-overview-view`, use the Search box at the top of the table, and enter the race name

      * you should see all the :term:`events <event>` associated with this :term:`race`
      * click on the :term:`event` for the coming year, then click **Edit**

   2. from :ref:`admin-calendar-view`, navigate to the date of the :term:`race's <race>` :term:`event`

      * click on the :term:`event`

Now you can edit the :term:`event` with the current details and when ready send the contract.

   * fill in as much information as you have available to you
   * change **State** to *tentative* 

     * **this is very important, if you don't do this the race
       director will receive extra confusing emails and we'll lose track of what we're doing**

   * click **Update**

     * or if you're ready to generate a contract, click **Update and Send Contract**


.. _race-director-questions:

When the Race Director has Questions
--------------------------------------

Some questions you get will have to go through the Race Services/Equipment
Coordinator, as you won't be able to handle them -- generally these are 
questions about how to manage a race rather than contract related stuff.
Probably best way to handle this is to forward to the Race Services/Equipment
Coordinator,  copying the RD, with appropriate text that the Race
Services/Equipment Coordinator is best suited to respond. If the  Race
Services/Equipment Coordinator  gets information from them which needs to be in
the database and you're not copied, he'll need to get it to you.


.. _race-details-confirmed:

When Race Details are Confirmed by Race Director
------------------------------------------------

As the details are confirmed by the race director, use the :ref:`edit-event-view` to update the :term:`event`. When
all the details are known and the race director is ready, generate the contract. 

You can edit an :term:`event` in one of two ways.

1. from :ref:`admin-calendar-view` navigate to the :term:`event` date and then click on the :term:`event` 
2. from :ref:`event-overview-view` click **Edit**

Before you can generate a contract for finish line services, you need at least the following:

   :Race: the name of the :term:`race`
   :Date: the date of the :term:`event`
   :Course: the :term:`course` the :term:`race` will be run on
   :Start Time: time of day that the main :term:`event` starts
   :Distance: distance for the :term:`race`
   :Client: the name of the :term:`client`
   :Services: one or more services which the client is contracting for
   :Max Participants: this is used to determine the pricing for 
       finishline :term:`services <service>` services (this is set to 200 for a new race or
       a race that had fewer than 201 finishers the previous year. If it is a repeat
       race and the number of finishers in the previous year was greater than 200, it’s
       the number of finishers the previous year rounded up to the next 100.

   :Lead: the leader who will run the finish line operation on the day of the
       :term:`event`. This needs to be 
       finalized well before the event so that emails are sent properly to all concerned

Before you can generate a contract for premium promotion service (only), you need at least the following:

   :Race: the name of the :term:`race`
   :Date: the date of the :term:`event`
   :Course: the :term:`course` the :term:`race` will be run on
   :Client: the name of the :term:`client`
   :Services: one or more services which the client is contracting for

The remaining fields are useful as well, and should be filled in if applicable and known.


.. _agreement-accepted-race-treasurer:

When Race Director Accepts Agreement (Treasurer)
-------------------------------------------------

When a race director accepts the agreement, the treasurer will receive an email. The :term:`event` will 
automatically be transitioned into the *committed* :term:`state`. 

An invoice should be generated to the :term:`client` as indicated by the financial policies. Once an invoice is 
generated, the treasurer should click the **Invoice Sent** button on the :ref:`edit-event-view`. 


.. _agreement-accepted-race-services:

When Race Director Accepts Agreement (Race Services Admin)
-----------------------------------------------------------

When a race director accepts the agreement, the race services admin will receive an email. The :term:`event` will 
automatically be transitioned into the *committed* :term:`state`. 

The :term:`lead` for the race needs to be identified well before the event so that resources are allocated 
correctly and emails are sent to the appropriate people. Generally we should have a commitment for a :term:`lead`
before sending the contract to the race director, however the system does not enforce this.


.. _contract-for-premium-promotion:

When We Contract for Premium Promotion (Communications)
----------------------------------------------------------

The communications team handles all premium promotion, regardless of whether the race has also contracted for
other services.

To determine the events for the next premium promotion email, use the :ref:`event-overview-view` filters:

   :States: select *committed*
   :Date Range: From the day the email goes out, To [3 months] after that
   :Service(s): select *premiumpromotion*

The table will be filtered to only the :term:`events <event>` which should be in the next email.

The **CSV** button can be used to download these :term:`events <event>`, if desired.


.. _changes-to-committed-agreement:

When Changes Need to be Made to a Committed Agreement
---------------------------------------------------------------

Occasionally, after the race director has agreed to the contract, there needs to
be a change. E.g., if the race director decides on premium promotion after the
initial agreement, a change needs to be made.

When the contract is in *committed* :term:`state`, the **Update and Send
Contract** button is desensitized.

If it's necessary to change the contract after the initial agreement, simply
edit the :term:`event`, make the  needed changes (e.g., add *premiumpromotion*),
and change the :term:`state` to *tentative*. By changing  the :term:`state`, the
**Update and Send Contract** button will be sensitized, and can be clicked to
send another contract.

Note once this is done, the system voids previous contract and it is not accessible.


.. _exception-required:

When an Exception to Standard Availability Rules is Needed
----------------------------------------------------------------

Normally, events are allowed on weekends and not allowed on weekdays. There are some holidays during the week when
we want to allow events, and some weekend days we don't want to allow events. For these, we need to configure
:term:`exceptions <exception>`.

To create exceptions, use the :ref:`event-exceptions-view`.
