  business. The primary functions provided by the system include:

  * electronic contract generation, signing and archival capabilities
  * Email system designed to automate the communication with race directors, race 
    services administrators and race services leads

    previous year's bookings

  This system is designed to significantly reduce the administrative workload required to manage the club's race services business.
