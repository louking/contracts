This document describes the **contractility** contract management system, for race contract management. Race 
directors generate race services requests to the administrator, who uses the system to create a record about 
the :term:`event` and generate a contract. The contract is email to the race director and the race services team. 
The race director accepts the contract through the system which generates another email and marks the
:term:`event` *committed*.

.. _contact-new-race:

When We Learn About a New Race
------------------------------

We learn about a new :term:`race` either through email generated by the :ref:`race-services-request-view`, other 
email, etc. Often there is incomplete information. Regardless, you should create the :term:`event` with whatever
information you have.

You can create an :term:`event` in one of two ways.

1. From :ref:`admin-calendar-view` click on the :term:`event` date
2. From :ref:`event-overview-view` click **New**

Once the form is displayed

   * fill in as much information as you have available to you
   * click Create

**If the Race has Finish Line Services** - Race directors may be contacting you with incomplete
information, and if so you will have to chase them down  to find all the relevant bits. This may
have to be done over time as often when they first contact us they may not have  all of the
information themselves.

**If the Race has Only Premium Promotion** - Premium promotion is executed through the
communications group rather than race services. We'll still be using  this tool to track that. It is
expected that the communication group will look at the **contractility** data periodically to
determine what races are to be promoted. See :ref:`contract-for-premium-promotion` for more details.


.. _contact-legacy-race:

When We're Contacted for a Race We've Done Before
------------------------------------------------------

If we've done a :term:`race` before, there will already be a database entry for the :term:`race`, and likely the
:term:`event` was :term:`renewed <renew>` after the previous year's race. 

You need to verify the current details with the race director and update the :term:`event` which was created.

You can find the event to edit in one of two ways.

   1. From :ref:`event-overview-view`, use the Search box at the top of the table, and enter the race name

      a. You should see all the :term:`events <event>` associated with this :term:`race`
      b. Click on the :term:`event` for the coming year, then click **Edit**

   2. From :ref:`admin-calendar-view`, navigate to the date of the :term:`race's <race>` :term:`event`

      a. Click on the :term:`event`

Now you can edit the :term:`event` with the current details and when ready send the contract.

   * fill in as much information as you have available to you
   * click **Update**
      * or if you're ready to generate a contract, click **Update and Send Contract**


.. _race-director-questions:

When the Race Director has Questions
--------------------------------------

Some questions you get will have to go through Mark, as you won't be able to handle them -- generally these are 
questions about how to manage a race rather than contract related stuff. Probably best way to handle this is to 
forward to Mark, copying the RD, with appropriate text that Mark is best suited to respond. Hopefully if Mark 
gets information from them which needs to be in the database and you're not copied, he'll get it to you.


.. _race-details-confirmed:

When Race Details are Confirmed by Race Director
------------------------------------------------

When all the details are confirmed by the race director, use the :ref:`edit-event-view` to generate the contract.

Before you can generate a contract for finish line services, you need at least the following:

   :Race: the name of the :term:`race`
   :Date: the date of the :term:`event`
   :Course: the :term:`course` the :term:`race` will be run on
   :Start Time: time of day that the main :term:`event` starts
   :Distance: distance for the :term:`race`
   :Client: the name of the :term:`client`
   :Services: one or more services which the client is contracting for
   :Max Participants: this is used to determine the pricing for finishline :term:`services <service>`

Before you can generate a contract for premium promotion service (only), you need at least the following:

   :Race: the name of the :term:`race`
   :Date: the date of the :term:`event`
   :Client: the name of the :term:`client`
   :Services: one or more services which the client is contracting for

The other field which must be filled in soon is the following, but this doesn't need to be ready before the contract
is sent.

   :Lead: the leader who will run the finish line operation on the day of the :term:`event`. This needs to be identified 
      well before the event so that emails are sent properly to all concerned

The remaining fields are useful as well, and should be filled in if applicable and known.


.. _agreement-accepted-race-treasurer:

When Race Director Accepts Agreement (Treasurer)
-------------------------------------------------

When a race director accepts the agreement, the treasurer will receive an email. The :term:`event` will 
automatically be transitioned into the *committed* :term:`state`. 

An invoice should be generated to the :term:`client` as indicated by the financial policies. Once an invoice is 
generated, the treasurer should click the **Invoice Sent** button on the :ref:`edit-event-view`. 


.. _agreement-accepted-race-services:

When Race Director Accepts Agreement (Race Services Admin)
-----------------------------------------------------------

When a race director accepts the agreement, the race services admin will receive an email. The :term:`event` will 
automatically be transitioned into the *committed* :term:`state`. 

The :term:`lead` for the race needs to be identified well before the event so that resources are allocated 
correctly and emails are sent to the appropriate people. Generally we should have a committment for a :term:`lead`
before sending the contract to the race director, however the system does not enforce this.


.. _contract-for-premium-promotion:

When We Contract for Premium Promotion (Communications)
----------------------------------------------------------

The communications team handles all premium promotion, regardless of whether the race has also contracted for
other services.

To determine the events for the next premium promotion email, use the :ref:`event-overview-view` filters:

   :States: select *committed*
   :Date Range: From the day the email goes out, To [3 months] after that
   :Service(s): select *premiumpromotion*

The table will be filtered to only the :term:`events <event>` which should be in the next email.

The **CSV** button can be used to download these :term:`events <event>`, if desired.


.. _changes-to-committed-agreement:

When Changes Need to be Made to a Committed Agreement
---------------------------------------------------------------

Occasionally, after the race director has agreed to the contract, there needs to be a change. E.g., if the race
director decides on premium promotion after the initial agreement, a change needs to be made.

When the contract is in *committed* :term:`state`, the **Update and Send Contract** button is desensitized.

If it's necessary to change the contract after the initial agreement, simply edit the :term:`event`, make the 
needed changes (e.g., add *premiumpromotion*), and change the :term:`state` to *tentative*. By changing the 
:term:`state`, the **Update and Send Contract** button will be sensitized, and can be clicked to send another
contract.

Note once this is done, the system voids previous contract and it is not accessible.
